<p>Fried Rice with Egg Festival, informally observed annually on November 25 as the anniversary of the death in 1950 of Mao Zedong's son Mao Anying, by people who are grateful that Mao's grip on China did not extend to a second generation (The younger Mao died in an American air raid in Korea, and, according to a popular account, his death was the result of cooking fried rice with egg, which produced smoke detected by US forces.)</p>
